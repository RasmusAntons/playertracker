## Features:

The mod gives every player a *player tracker*, a compass that can be used to cycle through all online players and point to their current location.

The player tracker cannot be dropped, traded or put into any non-player inventory.

## Usage:

The mod should be installed on server and client. \
It technically works server side only, but the client side removes the update animation whenever the compass target changes.

To make sure every player has a player tracker at all times, enable the game rule `givePlayerTracker`. \
Otherwise, a player tracker can be given with `/give @p minecraft:compass[minecraft:custom_data={playertracker:1b}]`, in this case they will be deleted if dropped by the player.
